# Taylor's dotfiles [WIP]

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

### Installing

Go to your home directory, clone the repo, and run the install script.

```
cd
git clone git@github.com:taylorvance/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/install.sh
```

This will create symlinks in your home directory for everything in dotfiles/home/. If there are any conflicts, your original files will be automatically backed up to dotfiles/backups/.
